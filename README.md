**NewsFeed**

This is a News Aggregator web application built with React that allows users to view and search for the latest news articles from various sources. The app fetches data from the News API (https://newsapi.org/) to display the top headlines and allows users to search for articles based on keywords.

Search for news articles based on keywords using the search bar.
View detailed information about each article, including the title, description, author, source, published date, and image.
Bookmark articles and view them in the bookmarks section on the left sidebar.
Responsive design that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

**Technologies Used**
React: Frontend JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React Router: For handling routing and navigation within the app.
Axios: For making HTTP requests to the News API.
Semantic UI: For styling the components and providing a modern look and feel.
Bootstrap: For additional styling and responsiveness.
